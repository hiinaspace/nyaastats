# Data directory for ETL outputs

This directory should contain the following files generated by the ETL pipeline:

- `episodes.parquet` - Daily episode statistics (generated by nyaastats-etl)
- `rankings.json` - Weekly rankings data (generated by nyaastats-etl)

To generate these files, run from the project root:

```bash
uv run nyaastats-etl --db nyaastats.db --output website/src/data
```

These files are gitignored since they're generated artifacts.
